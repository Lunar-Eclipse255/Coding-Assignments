        <h2>Murder of Henry Clerval</h2>
        <img class="cropped-image" src="../Images/Clarvel.png">
        <p>Henry Clerval, son of a Businessman, died recently on 
            the coast of Ireland. His cause of death was strangling. 
            The main suspect was Victor Frankenstein, a friend of Henry 
            Clerval. It was stated by one of the witnesses that, <em>“</em> 
            She [I] lived near the beach and was standing at the door of her 
            [the] cottage, waiting for the return of the fishermen, about an hour
             before she [I] heard of the discovery of the body, when she [I] saw 
             a boat with only one man in it push off from that part of the shore 
             where the corpse was afterwards found <em>”</em> (Shelley 180). After 
             hearing the cause of death and seeing the corpse of Henry Clerval, 
             Victor Frankenstein, became feverous with his body becoming agitated, 
             and he began to rave. Due to this, Victor Frankenstein was temporarily
              imprisoned for two months, in a near death state, the trial was to 
              recommence when he recovered. After the two months, Victor’s name was
               cleared due to other witnesses proving Frankenstein’s alibi.</p>
