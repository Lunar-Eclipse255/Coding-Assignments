        <h2>Genevan Scientist Gone</h2>
        <img class="cropped-image" src="../Images/Fled.png">
        <p>Victor Frankenstein, an esteemed Genevan 
            scientist, a man with almost no family left 
            because they were either murdered or died from 
            grief. He has disappeared from Geneva, with few
            clues to his current whereabouts. The last person 
            he spoke to was the local Genevan Magistrate, the 
            Magistrate said that Victor spoke of a monster of 
            his own creation, and it was this monster that killed
                his family. When the Magistrate stated that it would 
                not be practical to capture this monster, it was Victor 
                Frankenstein who said, <em>“</em> That cannot be, but all that I 
                can say will be of little avail. My revenge is of no moment
                to you; yet, while I allow it to be a vice, I confess 
                that it is the devouring and only passion of my soul.
                My rage is unspeakable when I reflect that the murderer,
                whom I have turned loose upon society, still exists. 
                You refuse my just demand; I have but one resource,
                    and I devote myself, either in my life or death, to
                    his destruction <em>”</em> (Shelley 204). After this, there have
                    been reports, further and further, north speaking of an
                    eight-foot tall human, followed by a human matching Victor’s.</p>
