        <h3>Switzerland: </h3>
        <p>
            Swiss Alps, sound great don’t they, with them, you can escape 
            your busy lives for weeks and take a calm repose, a break from 
            everything. You could take a stroll or even climb the alps if you want.
             If you want a different style of break, you could go to the numerous 
             towns we have, all active but a great break from the busy urban life. 
             The air here is fresher and the skies brighter. <em>Go Swiss, Stay Positive.</em>

        <h3>Arctic: </h3>
        <p>
            For glory, there is the Arctic, If you reach the top of 
            the Arctic, you would be the first to do so and your name 
            would live on forever, immortal throughout time. It would 
            be a tough and expensive journey, but is very much worth the 
            trip due to the winter wonderland it is.
