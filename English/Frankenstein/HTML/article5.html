            I would like to warn others why 
            they should never follow in my footsteps. 
            To work with life is to play with life, and 
            one should never take that lightly. I made the 
            mistake to spite life by creating a superhuman, 
            of increased, stature, strength, and intelligence. 
            I did this because I wanted to be known throughout 
            the world. I wanted my name to be ever living, 
            but instead I became famous due to the tragedy of
             my life, with everyone in my family dying from my 
             own Machination. I killed, a servant, a brother, a 
             friend, a wife, and a father. I saw what the lure of 
             glory did to me and I would like to warn others, to 
             not walk that path, at the expense of other lives.
              I almost allowed this monster to become the end of
               humanity because I almost created a partner for 
               the dæmon I created. Do not let glory come above
                all.

            I have no name, but I do have a voice, but more important, 
            in this case, the ability to write. I have been seen as a 
            monster, but that is wrong. I was first shunned and attacked 
            by humanity, and now all I want is companionship. The murders 
            were a way to get to my creator, a creator who fled from me when 
            he first saw me. How would you have liked to have been with a fully
             formed brain, and having your mother see you then run away from 
             you, hoping to never see you again. You would feel as if there 
             were something wrong with you. Then how would you feel that if 
             anyone saw you, they would scream at you, then proceed to attack
              you. This is why I want to go to a secluded location. But first 
              I wanted a companion, so, I did the only thing I could, forcing 
              my creator. At first, he did as I asked, but then he murdered my 
              companion as well as my future, so I did the same to him, killing
               his companion and future. When I put it like that does it seem so
                bad what I have done

        <p>I do not understand all these things about my friend Victor Frankenstein.
             I have been told that he has created a monster of an eight-foot stature,
              and superhuman strength. I was told that this monster is what killed 
              William and I. But the Victor I know would never have done that, would
               he? I know he spoke of things like this, but at the time I thought 
               he was delirious due to extreme fatigue and extreme guilt. I thought
                this monster was of his mind’s creation, not a physical that he 
                created with his own two hands. Would the Victor I knew have created 
                this thing that strangled me and killed me, but my last moments are
                too fuzzy to remember. For all that is good in the world, I hope this 
                monster was only a creation of his mind.
