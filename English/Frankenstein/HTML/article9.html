        <h2>Gossip</h2>
        <p>
            The Frankenstein’s are a peculiar and tragic family, 
            with most of the family dying off. It's rumored that 
            Justine was actually innocent, with the church forcing 
            her to confess, or else she would go to purgatory. The 
            murderer seems to still be out there after Justine was 
            hanged because every murdered Frankenstein died by the 
            same hands that left the same blackened hands. It's also
             been rumored that Victor was the one who made a monster 
             made of corpses. And it rumored that it is this monster 
             who killed the Frankensteins. Or is Victor the murderer 
             and just has split personalities, one more murderous than
              the other. I mean, Victor was arrested in Ireland for the
               murder of Henry Clerval. Then the Magistrate found out 
               Victor was an Aristocrat, and we know how that goes. But
                he wasn’t here when poor William died, so is it really 
                a monster, and is the monster still out there? If the 
                monster is done with the Frankenstein’s who is next?
