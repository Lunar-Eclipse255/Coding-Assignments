chaos before the beginning of time. Out of these waters rose Atum; he created himself using his thoughts and the sheer force of his will.
He created a hill, for there was nowhere he could stand."</p>


<p class = "my-headingFour">I would describe the presence of this motif as a common starting to many creation myths. I find it as an 
intresting set up to many other motifs. It is often called before/accompanied with the Cosmic egg, Power of the Word, and/or World Tree 
motifs. It offers entertainment value by being a blank start that can go almost anywhere, a blank page. The core issue that it speaks to is 
the thought of what came before us. </p>


<p class = "my-headingFour">The pratical explanation of this motif could be that these civilizations wanted an explanation for how they and 
the world came to be, and from nothing was the most logical because something must come from nothing.</p>

<p class = "my-headingFour">The Time before Time motif is a blank start for the civilizations to ask their questions and make their answers. 
With a blank canvas any god, thing, or symbol can appear to help explain something at the time thought to be unexplainable. </p>
