Consider the problem of designing a Locker object to model a locker similar to the one you use at school.  Each locker should contain the following:

 

    Locker number (between 0001-2000)
    To whom the locker belongs (the person’s name)
    Locker combination (this is a six-digit number)
    Hall that the locker is on
    Whether the locker is open or closed

 

 

 

When a locker is created, it must be assigned a number, the person’s name to whom it belongs, and the hall the locker is on.  New lockers should have random combinations generated for them and should be closed initially.

 

Operations on a locker include, but are not limited to, the following:

 

    Assign a new locker combination.
    Reassign the locker to a new person.  When this is done, the combination should also be changed (there is more than one correct way to do this).
    Open locker.  (To do this, the correct combination must be used.)
    Close locker.  (No combination is needed for the locker to be closed.)
    Retrieve the top/bottom status of the locker’s location. (Odd lockers are top lockers and even lockers are bottom ones.)
    Retrieve the hall the locker is on.
    Retrieve the combination of the locker.
    Retrieve the open/closed status of the locker.
    Retrieve a string containing all of the attributes of the locker.  Label the information.

 

Write the class declaration for the Locker object.  In writing this class you must:

    Choose appropriate instance variables and method names.
    Provide the functionality specified above.
