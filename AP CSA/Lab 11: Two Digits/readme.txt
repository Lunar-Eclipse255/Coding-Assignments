Write a program that accepts an integer n as input and that prints a series of n randomly generated numbers. The method should use Math.random() to select numbers in the range of 10 to 19 inclusive where each number is equally likely to be chosen. 
After displaying each number that was produced, the method should indicate whether the number 13 was ever selected ("we saw a 13!") or not ("no 13 was seen.").  You may assume that the value of n entered is at least 0.
