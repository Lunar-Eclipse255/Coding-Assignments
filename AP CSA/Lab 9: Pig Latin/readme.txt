Have the user enter a word
If the word ends with “ing” then move the last 4 letters of the word to beginning of the word (they should no longer be at the end), else if word ends in a vowel add pig to the end of word, else add haha to the beginning of word. 
Must utilize both equals() and charAt()
Must have comments
