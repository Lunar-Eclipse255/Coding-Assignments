Create your own class: the Cat Class.  

Cats are described by their name, their age, their weight, their age and their color.   
Should have a default constructor and one where a user is able to specify all details with parameters.  

Make the following methods: getDirty() method which turns cat object brown, meow() which makes cat say Meow! 
Then cat name, and isHealthy() which returns true if cat is less than 15 lbs and less than 4 years old, 
otherwise returns false.
