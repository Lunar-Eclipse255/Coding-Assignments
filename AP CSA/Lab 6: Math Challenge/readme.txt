For each number from 0 – 100, you will write a single line of code to output that integer value using only the digits found in 2021 and 2022. You must use EVERY digit (all 8) in each statement

Example:

System.out.println(2+0+2+1+2x0+2+2);

This line would output 9

Rules

·      You do not have to solve a number before you can go to the next

·      Keep your code in order as you solve numbers

·      Order of Operations can be your friend or enemy.

·      Valid operations - + - / %(modulus) ( )

·      Math Commands

1.  Math.abs(int a)       Math.abs(a)     Math.pow( base,  exponent)

2.  Math.sqrt( a)          Math.ceil( a)    Math.floor( a)

 

3.  Math.round( a)
